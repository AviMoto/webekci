Web application firewalls (WAF) are gaining importance among the information security technologies designed to protect web sites from attack. WAF solutions prevent attacks that network firewalls and intrusion detection systems can't and they require no modification of application source code. [ModSecurity](http://www.modsecurity.org) is an open source web application firewall that runs as an Apache module. It is an embeddable web application firewall and it provides protection from a range of attacks against web applications. It is an open source project available to everyone; it however does not come with an admin panel.

ModSecurity allows for HTTP traffic monitoring and real-time analysis with no changes to existing infrastructure. The key aspects of the WeBekci is to setup domains, configuring ModSecurity, writing/analyzing rules, logging and reporting on an Apache infrastructure.
